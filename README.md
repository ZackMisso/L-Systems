This project is an implementation of L-Systems in C++

The current L-Systems implementation supports any alphabet and
any form of semantics. However, the current gui implementation
supports the following semantics.

L-System Semantics for current Gui:

F    :: move forward
+    :: clockwise rotation
-    :: counterclockwise rotation
[    :: push
]    :: pop

Here is some eye-candy from the current gui
